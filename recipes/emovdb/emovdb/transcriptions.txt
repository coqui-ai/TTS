( arctic_a0093 "For a full minute he crouched and listened." )
( arctic_a0094 "He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire." )
( arctic_a0095 "A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision." )
( arctic_a0096 "Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest." )
( arctic_a0097 "Then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow." )
( arctic_a0098 "Shall I carry you." )
( arctic_a0099 "A maddening joy pounded in his brain." )
( arctic_a0100 "You must sleep, he urged." )
( arctic_a0101 "You, you would not keep the truth from me." )
( arctic_a0102 "He will follow us soon." )
( arctic_a0103 "But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe." )
( arctic_a0104 "She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child." )
( arctic_a0105 "Only, it is so wonderful, so almost impossible to believe." )
( arctic_a0106 "The emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob." )
( arctic_a0107 "If you only could know how I thank you." )
( arctic_a0108 "He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself." )
( arctic_a0109 "Do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you." )
( arctic_a0110 "Much, replied Jeanne, as tersely." )
( arctic_a0111 "Instead, he joined her; and they ate like two hungry children." )
( arctic_a0112 "He was wounded in the arm." )
( arctic_a0113 "I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians." )
( arctic_a0114 "Her words sent a strange chill through Philip." )
( arctic_a0115 "He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him." )
( arctic_a0116 "Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin." )
( arctic_a0117 "She added, with genuine sympathy in her face and voice." )
( arctic_a0118 "Pierre obeys me when we are together." )
( arctic_a0119 "Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward." )
( arctic_a0120 "My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante." )
( arctic_a0121 "They ate dinner at the fifth, and rested for two hours." )
( arctic_a0122 "Two years ago I gave up civilization for this." )
( arctic_a0123 "She had died from cold and starvation." )
( arctic_a0124 "It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks." )
( arctic_a0125 "He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself." )
( arctic_a0126 "Each day she became a more vital part of him." )
( arctic_a0127 "It was a temptation, but he resisted it." )
( arctic_a0128 "This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born." )
( arctic_a0129 "Her face was against his breast." )
( arctic_a0130 "She was his now, forever." )

( arctic_a0134 "He obeyed the pressure of her hand." )
( arctic_a0135 "I am going to surprise father, and you will go with Pierre." )
( arctic_a0136 "About him, everywhere, were the evidences of luxury and of age." )
( arctic_a0137 "Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure." )
( arctic_a0138 "In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne." )
( arctic_a0139 "He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes." )
( arctic_a0140 "Accept a father's blessing, and with it, this." )
( arctic_a0141 "It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God." )
( arctic_a0142 "Such things had occurred before, he told Philip." )
( arctic_a0143 "Ah, I had forgotten, he exclaimed." )
( arctic_a0144 "But there was something even more startling than this resemblance." )
( arctic_a0145 "I have to be careful of them, as they tear very easily." )
( arctic_a0146 "Of course, that is uninteresting, she continued." )
( arctic_a0147 "A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness." )
( arctic_a0148 "Now these things had been struck dead within him." )
( arctic_a0149 "For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky." )
( arctic_a0150 "Goodbye, Pierre, he shouted." )
( arctic_a0151 "And MacDougall was beyond the trail, with three weeks to spare." )
( arctic_a0152 "Philip thrust himself against it and entered." )
( arctic_a0153 "MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger." )
( arctic_a0154 "He was smooth-shaven, and his hair and eyes were black." )
( arctic_a0155 "Won't you draw up, gentlemen." )
( arctic_a0156 "A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned." )
( arctic_a0157 "He had worshiped her, as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice." )
( arctic_a0158 "Does that look good." )
( arctic_a0159 "They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life." )
( arctic_a0160 "You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt." )
( arctic_a0161 "Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub." )
( arctic_a0162 "That's the sub-foreman, explained Thorpe." )
( arctic_a0163 "Philip made no effort to follow." )
( arctic_a0164 "He came first a year ago, and revealed himself to Jeanne." )
( arctic_a0165 "They are to attack your camp tomorrow night." )
( arctic_a0166 "Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding." )
( arctic_a0167 "I was near the cabin, and saw you." )
( arctic_a0168 "Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting." )
( arctic_a0169 "Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant." )
( arctic_a0170 "There was none of the joy of meeting in his face." )
( arctic_a0171 "And when you come back in a few days, bring Eileen." )
( arctic_a0172 "Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar." )
( arctic_a0173 "The date was nearly eighteen years old." )
( arctic_a0174 "They were the presage of storm." )

( arctic_a0178 "Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated." )
( arctic_a0179 "Tomorrow I'm going after that bear, he said." )
( arctic_a0180 "If not, let's say our prayers and go to bed." )
( arctic_a0181 "So cheer up, and give us your paw." )
( arctic_a0182 "This time he did not yap for mercy." )
( arctic_a0183 "And the air was growing chilly." )
( arctic_a0184 "Don't you see, I'm chewing this thing in two." )
( arctic_a0185 "The questions may have come vaguely in his mind." )
( arctic_a0186 "Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl." )
( arctic_a0187 "Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine." )
( arctic_a0188 "Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass." )
( arctic_a0189 "The big-eyed, clucking moose-birds were most annoying." )

( arctic_a0194 "He drank of the water cautiously." )
( arctic_a0195 "But a strange thing happened." )
( arctic_a0196 "He began to follow the footprints of the dog." )
( arctic_a0197 "Such a dog the wise driver kills, or turns loose." )
( arctic_a0198 "Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions." )
( arctic_a0199 "Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day." )
( arctic_a0200 "He leapt again, and the club caught him once more." )
( arctic_a0201 "He cried, and swung the club wildly." )
( arctic_a0202 "She turned, fearing that Jacques might see what was in her face." )
( arctic_a0203 "They were following the shore of a lake." )
( arctic_a0204 "The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him." )
( arctic_a0205 "From now on we're pals." )
( arctic_a0206 "He says he bought him of Jacques Le Beau." )
( arctic_a0207 "How much was it." )
( arctic_a0208 "Youth had come back to her, freed from the yoke of oppression." )
( arctic_a0209 "It was not a large lake, and almost round." )
( arctic_a0210 "Its diameter was not more than two hundred yards." )
( arctic_a0211 "It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made." )
( arctic_a0212 "Fresh cases, still able to walk, they clustered about the spokesman." )
( arctic_a0213 "Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound." )

( arctic_a0221 "I don't know why you're here at all." )
( arctic_a0222 "What part of the United States is your home." )
( arctic_a0223 "My, I'm almost homesick for it already." )
( arctic_a0224 "She nodded, and her eyes grew soft and moist." )
( arctic_a0225 "I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up." )
