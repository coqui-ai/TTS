"""
    This recipe replicates the first experiment proposed in the YourTTS paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.02418).
    YourTTS model is based on the VITS model however it uses external speaker embeddings extracted from a pre-trained speaker encoder and has small architecture changes.
    In addition, YourTTS can be trained in multilingual data, however, this recipe replicates the single language training using the VCTK dataset.
    If you are interested in multilingual training, we have commented on parameters on the VitsArgs class instance that should be enabled for multilingual training.
    In addition, you will need to add the extra datasets following the VCTK as an example.
