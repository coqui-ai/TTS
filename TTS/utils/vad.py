    Given a webrtcvad.Vad and a source of audio frames, yields only
    the voiced audio.

    Uses a padded, sliding window algorithm over the audio frames.
    When more than 90% of the frames in the window are voiced (as
    reported by the VAD), the collector triggers and begins yielding
    audio frames. Then the collector waits until 90% of the frames in
    the window are unvoiced to detrigger.

    The window is padded at the front and back to provide a small
    amount of silence or the beginnings/endings of speech around the
    voiced frames.

    Arguments:

    sample_rate - The audio sample rate, in Hz.
    frame_duration_ms - The frame duration in milliseconds.
    padding_duration_ms - The amount to pad the window, in milliseconds.
    vad - An instance of webrtcvad.Vad.
    frames - a source of audio frames (sequence or generator).

    Returns: A generator that yields PCM audio data.
